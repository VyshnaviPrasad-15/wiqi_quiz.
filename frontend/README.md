# Frontend (React + Vite)

This frontend is a minimal Vite + React app using Tailwind CSS. It communicates with the backend at http://localhost:8000 by default.

To run:

1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

If your backend runs on a different host/port, set the environment variable REACT_APP_API_BASE before starting (or edit src/services/api.js).
